(46.729553, -94.6859) 
The Chicago Great Western Depot at 726 East Main Street in Red Wing, in the U.S. State of Minnesota, is a former railroad station listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The depot was built in 1906 after the Chicago Great Western Railway (CGW) acquired two small railroads: the Minnesota Central, which connected to Cannon Falls; and the Duluth, Red Wing, and Southern, which connected to Zumbrota. CGW established a divisional headquarters and built this depot in 1906, with passenger space on the first floor and office space on the second floor. The red brick structure was the largest depot the railroad built in Minnesota.
