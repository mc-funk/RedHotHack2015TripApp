* Bicycle into town
* Receive a notification “Welcome to Red Wing”
* Receive a notification of a Civil War walking tour (a particular interest) in an hour
* Notify of key sites of similar attractions and historical markers
* Notify of food, bicycle shops, shopping on the way to the tour start point
* Notifications vanish after they are out-of-range by X feet/miles

Scenario – RV travelers Tom and Linda are at a campsite with WiFi a few miles from a town they plan to visit the next day
The evening before leaving for their visit, they pull up the program/app/website and research the location and available attractions
The application displays a variety of attractions based on historical preferences
With the planned time frame for the visit, the application maps out an itinerary that can be edited and saved
The itinerary contains historical information and lists resources/links/books for further research.
